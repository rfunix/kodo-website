Kōdo supports closures (anonymous functions) that can capture variables from their enclosing scope. The compiler uses **lambda lifting** to transform closures into regular functions at compile time.

## Basic Closures

A closure is defined with `|params| { body }` syntax:

```rust
let double = |x: Int| -> Int { return x * 2 }
```

## Closures as Function Parameters

Closures are most useful when passed to higher-order functions:

```rust
fn apply(f: (Int) -> Int, x: Int) -> Int {
    return f(x)
}

fn main() {
    let result: Int = apply(|x: Int| -> Int { return x * 3 }, 10)
    print_int(result)  // 30
}
```

## Function Types

Function types use the `(ParamTypes) -> ReturnType` syntax:

```rust
fn apply_twice(f: (Int) -> Int, x: Int) -> Int {
    let once: Int = f(x)
    return f(once)
}

fn main() {
    let result: Int = apply_twice(|x: Int| -> Int { return x + 1 }, 5)
    print_int(result)  // 7
}
```

## Passing Named Functions

Named functions can also be passed where a function type is expected:

```rust
fn square(x: Int) -> Int {
    return x * x
}

fn apply(f: (Int) -> Int, x: Int) -> Int {
    return f(x)
}

fn main() {
    let result: Int = apply(square, 4)
    print_int(result)  // 16
}
```

## Capturing Variables

Closures can capture variables from their enclosing scope. The compiler performs **capture analysis** and transforms the closure into a top-level function with the captured variables passed as extra parameters (lambda lifting):

```rust
fn make_adder(n: Int) -> (Int) -> Int {
    return |x: Int| -> Int { return x + n }
}

fn main() {
    let add5 = make_adder(5)
    print_int(add5(10))  // 15
}
```

Internally, the closure `|x| { x + n }` is lifted to a function `__closure_0(x: Int, n: Int) -> Int` and the captured variable `n` is passed automatically at the call site.

## How Lambda Lifting Works

Lambda lifting is a compiler technique that eliminates closures by converting them to regular functions:

1. **Capture analysis**: The compiler identifies free variables in the closure body
2. **Lifting**: The closure becomes a top-level function with captured variables as extra parameters
3. **Call site transformation**: Where the closure is created, the captured values are passed as arguments

This means closures have zero runtime overhead compared to regular function calls — there is no heap-allocated closure object.

## Complete Example

```rust
module closures_demo {
    meta {
        purpose: "Demonstrate closures and higher-order functions",
        version: "0.1.0"
    }

    fn apply(f: (Int) -> Int, x: Int) -> Int {
        return f(x)
    }

    fn apply_twice(f: (Int) -> Int, x: Int) -> Int {
        let once: Int = f(x)
        return f(once)
    }

    fn main() {
        // Direct closure call
        let double: Int = apply(|x: Int| -> Int { return x * 2 }, 5)
        print_int(double)  // 10

        // Apply twice
        let result: Int = apply_twice(|x: Int| -> Int { return x + 3 }, 0)
        print_int(result)  // 6

        // Named function as argument
        print_int(apply(|x: Int| -> Int { return x * x }, 4))  // 16
    }
}
```
