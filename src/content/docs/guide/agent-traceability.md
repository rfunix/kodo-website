Kōdo is the first programming language with built-in support for tracking AI agent authorship and enforcing trust policies. This enables organizations to maintain accountability over AI-generated code.

## Annotations

### `@authored_by`

Declares who wrote a function — human or AI agent:

```rust
@authored_by(agent: "claude")
fn ai_generated() -> Int {
    return 42
}
```

### `@confidence`

Declares how confident the author is in the correctness of the code, on a scale from 0.0 to 1.0:

```rust
@confidence(0.95)
fn well_tested() -> Int {
    return 42
}
```

### `@reviewed_by`

Declares that a human has reviewed the code:

```rust
@reviewed_by(human: "alice")
fn human_approved() -> Int {
    return 42
}
```

### `@security_sensitive`

Marks a function as security-sensitive, requiring formal contracts:

```rust
@security_sensitive
fn validate_input(value: Int) -> Bool
    requires { value > 0 }
{
    return true
}
```

> **Note:** Contract expressions currently support integer and boolean comparisons. String comparisons in `requires`/`ensures` are not yet supported.

## Trust Policies

### Low Confidence Review (E0260)

Functions with `@confidence(X)` where X < 0.8 **must** have `@reviewed_by(human: "...")`:

```rust
// ERROR: @confidence(0.5) < 0.8 without review
@confidence(0.5)
fn risky() -> Int { return 42 }

// OK: low confidence but reviewed
@confidence(0.5)
@reviewed_by(human: "alice")
fn reviewed_risky() -> Int { return 42 }
```

### Security-Sensitive Contracts (E0262)

Functions marked `@security_sensitive` **must** have at least one `requires` or `ensures` clause.

## Confidence Propagation

Kōdo computes **transitive confidence** for each function. A function's computed confidence is the minimum of:
- Its own declared `@confidence` (defaults to 1.0 if not specified)
- The computed confidence of every function it calls

This means confidence propagates through the call chain — a function is only as trustworthy as its least trustworthy dependency.

### Module Confidence Threshold (E0261)

Set `min_confidence` in the `meta` block to enforce a minimum confidence level:

```rust
module secure_app {
    meta {
        purpose: "A security-critical application"
        min_confidence: "0.9"
    }

    @confidence(0.5)
    @reviewed_by(human: "alice")
    fn weak_link() -> Int { return 1 }

    fn main() -> Int {
        return weak_link()  // ERROR E0261: module confidence 0.50 < threshold 0.90
    }
}
```

### Confidence Report

Use `kodoc confidence-report` to inspect confidence across a module:

```bash
kodoc confidence-report my_module.ko

# Output:
# Confidence Report for module `my_module`
# ============================================================
# Overall confidence: 0.50
#
# Function                       Declared   Computed
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# weak_link                          0.50       0.50
# main                               1.00       0.50
```

For JSON output (suitable for AI agent consumption):

```bash
kodoc confidence-report my_module.ko --json
```

## Preventing Reviewer Forgery

A fundamental challenge with AI-generated code: an LLM could write `@reviewed_by(human: "alice")` in source code, bypassing trust enforcement. Kōdo addresses this with **trust identity verification** via `kodo.toml`.

### Configuring the `[trust]` Section

Add a `[trust]` section to your project's `kodo.toml`:

```toml
[trust]
# Names of known AI agents — never permitted as human reviewers.
known_agents = ["claude", "gpt-4", "copilot", "gemini"]

# Optional: allowlist of authorized human reviewers.
# When set, only listed names are accepted in @reviewed_by(human: "...").
human_reviewers = ["alice", "bob", "rfunix"]
```

Both fields are **opt-in**. A project without `[trust]` behaves exactly as before.

### What Gets Rejected

**E0263 — Agent claims human review**: If a function has `@reviewed_by(human: "claude")` and `"claude"` is in `known_agents`, the compiler rejects it:

```
error[E0263]: function `process_payment`: reviewer `claude` is a known AI agent
              and cannot claim human review
  --> src/main.ko:5:1
```

The auto-fix changes `human:` to `agent:`.

**E0264 — Reviewer not in allowlist**: If `human_reviewers` is set and the reviewer is not listed:

```
error[E0264]: function `process_payment`: reviewer `unknown` is not in the
              `human_reviewers` allowlist
  --> src/main.ko:5:1
```

### Combining with `kodoc audit`

Use `trust=verified` in the audit policy for CI/CD gating:

```bash
kodoc audit src/main.ko \
  --policy "min_confidence=0.8,reviewed=all,trust=verified"
```

This exits with code 1 if any `@reviewed_by(human: "X")` annotation names a known agent.

### Security Model

| Mechanism | Protection | Limitation |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| `known_agents` allowlist | Rejects obvious LLM identity strings | Gameable if agent uses an unlisted name |
| `human_reviewers` allowlist | Restricts valid reviewer identities | Gameable if attacker controls `kodo.toml` |
| CI git-blame check | Detects commits from bot accounts | Requires protected CI pipeline |
| Cryptographic signatures *(roadmap)* | Cryptographically binds review to a GPG key | Requires key management |

The recommended production setup: configure both lists in `kodo.toml`, protect it via branch protection rules, and add a CI step that verifies `@reviewed_by` annotations were committed by a human account.
